# My favorite character

My favorite chracter is Elisabeth Bannet from Pride and Pejudice from Jane Austen.
She goes her own way in a time when it is very difficult for woman to survive with dignity without a husband.
She has her own opinion and can express it.

## Other characters

* Jane Bennet
* Mr Darcy
* Charlott
